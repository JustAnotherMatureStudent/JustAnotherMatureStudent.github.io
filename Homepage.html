<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>When I was supporting the Napier Student Fair on behalf of my employer, I got chatting to some guys who were doing a user experience degree. I asked them for some user-experience tips that might help me meet the needs of this assessment. They asked who the website was for. I said "My lecturer". </br></P>
<p>After we laughed and talked some more I gave it some more thought. Exactly <em>who</em> is this website for? </br></p>

<p>The simple answer is that this website is intended to be used by people like me. People who lead busy lives and are short on time.</br></p>

<p>For instance, I'm short on time because I'm a dad, a husband and a Cyber-Security Graduate Apprentice which means that as well as my studies I also have a full-time job.</P> 

<p>In addition to those roles, I like to go to the gym to work out the stress of the day as well as keep myself active and strong.</br></p>

<p>While I don't consider myself old, I don't consider myself young either and I want to I want to remain as fit and strong as I can so I can keep up with my daughter as she grows up.</p>

<p>As parents, my wife and I want our daughter to eat healthily and we recognise the value of eating together as a family however it is a constant challenge to find the time to do each of these things.<p>

<p>The solution I've settled upon to meet this challenge is to slow cook a meal that requires as little preparation as possible.</br>
</p>

<p>In addition, I want a slow cooking website for people who are short on time to be simple to navigate - you shouldn't spend any more time than is necessary to get the information you need to make your slow cooked meal</p>

<p>If you're short on time and want to have a meal on the table for you and your kids after a busy day, this could be the website for you</p>
